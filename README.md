# Festive Tech Calendar 2021 : Demonstrating a Microservice application built around the Umbraco CMS v9 on Docker On Raspberry Pis

This demo is for people looking to get started with Docker and Microservices, and is a quick sample I've put together using the open source Umbraco Content Management system, running on Docker on a raspberry Pi. 


## These are the steps to run Umbraco on a Raspberry Pi

Minimum Requirements :

- At least 1 Raspberry Pi 3b+
    - Warning : this WILL be slow on a Pi 3b+
    - A Raspberry Pi 4 4gb or 8gb is recommended


## Documentation

- Steps to set up the Project
    - [setup.md](notes/setup.md)
- Set-up for Raspberry pi
